        <p>The goal of the University of Waterloo Capture the Flag (CTF) Club is to provide a competitive, comfortable, and challenging forum for those wishing to test their computer science skills and knowledge. We create this environment by hosting competitions, holding workshops, and preparing teams to participate in CTFs not hosted by the University of Waterloo.</p>

      <section>
        <p>CTF competitions are a set of online challenges that are created to determine participant mastery of various tools, algorithms, and information. Participant abilities are determined by whether they are able to retrieve specific information, known as flags, from the challenge presented.</p>

        <p><i>( For example, if the challenge is: "What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything?". The flag would be "42". )</i></p>

        <p>The category of questions typically present in CTFs are:<br/>
        > crypto,<br/>
        > forensics,<br/>
        > miscellaneous,<br/>
        > pwn,<br/>
        > reversing, and<br/>
        > web,<br/>
        but it is common for other challenge categories to appear depending on the feedback we receive from our participants.</p>

        <p>The only requirements to participate in a CTF are a <b>LAPTOP</b> and a <b>WILLINGNESS TO LEARN</b>. We structure questions so any one of any skill level is able to get at least get a few flags, while also providing challenges that may be out of reach for most participants.</p>
